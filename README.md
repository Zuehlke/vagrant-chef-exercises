# "Let's Hack Some Infrastructure!"

Demo repository for my ZDays 2015 talk "Let's Hack Some Infrastructure!"

It contains all the code snippets to be shown (more or less likely in that order...)

## Development Environment

I will probably start with the development environment for Windows, but then switch to the Linux based environment:

 * [Bill's Kitchen](https://github.com/tknerr/bills-kitchen) - a "DevPack" with all you need for cooking with Chef, Vagrant and Docker on Windows
 * [Linus' Kitchen](https://github.com/tknerr/dev-box/) - a developer VM with Chef, Vagrant and Docker for cooking on Linux


## Vagrant & Chef Introduction

 * [vagrant-basics](./vagrant-basics)
 * [vagrant-shell-provisioner](./vagrant-shell-provisioner)
 * [vagrant-multivm-and-networking](./vagrant-multivm-and-networking)
 * [vagrant-chef-provisioner](./vagrant-chef-provisioner)
